			<p>HyperText Markup Language</p>
			<p>For me, I think HTML is like the number one important part in coding for begineers and professionals. HTML helps us turn our codings into a website/apps that people can view pubicly. Without HTML, all social media apps or websites that we use everyday wouldn't exist right now. </p>

		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<h3 style="background-color:#B1C4E4;">CSS</h3>
			<p>Cascading Style Sheets</p>
			<p>For me, CSS helps our coding look a bit more professional with additional codings and different types of CSS that we can put in our HTML files. With the help of text properties and types of CSS, we can make our website more realistic and functional. Even though it works with HTML it helps the file to have more layout and format in order for the website to look good.   </p>

		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<h3 style="background-color: #D1E2F3;">Bootstrap</h3>
			<p>Bootstrap Version 4</p>
			<p>Lastly, Bootstrap can help make our HTML/CSS files helps us create exclusive design that HTML and CSS can't do. Even though today is my first time trying it, I have a good feeling that Bootstrap can be helpful for my future HTML/CSS files. Hopefully, this can help me improve more in my coding skills in the future.</p>
